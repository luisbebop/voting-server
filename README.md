# Voting platform

A simple voting application based on [this tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html).

The users can vote in a set of predefined options and the results are showed in realtime on a leaderboard.

It uses react and redux. This is the server. You need [the client](https://github.com/luisbebop/voting-server) as well.

npm install
npm run start
```
